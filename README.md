# PY Dijkstra's algorithm

Implementaion of Dijkstra's algorithim in Python to find the shortest path between two vertices in a weighted graph. 

The code uses Python's heapq library to maintain a priority queue for efficient distance calculations.

Output:
```py
Pathed from: A to D
Shortest distance to target: 2
Shortest path to target: A -> B -> D


Pathed from: A to: G
Shortest distance to target: 11
Shortest path to target: A -> C -> G
```
